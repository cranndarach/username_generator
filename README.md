# Username Generator

A small tool to generate usernames out of existing words.

## Corpus

This uses the 50k most frequent English words from [Google Ngrams](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html).

If you'd like to use another corpus, make sure you have a separate file for each part of speech in the `corpus/` directory. The files should be named
`pos.txt`, where "*pos*" is one of: *adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, determiners, nouns, prepositions,* and *verbs*. The files should contain one word per
line with no delimiters.

## Installation

First, clone or download the repository (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/cranndarach/username_generator.git`)

If you downloaded a compressed version, unzip it.

`cd` into the folder you just cloned/unzipped (`cd username_generator`).

If you want to install this as a Python package so that you can use it from anywhere via the command line,
