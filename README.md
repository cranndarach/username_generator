# Username Generator

A small tool to generate usernames out of existing words, turned into a website.

## Corpus

This uses the 50k most frequent English words from [Google Ngrams](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html).

If you'd like to use another corpus, make sure you make an array of words for each part of speech in `lib/corpus.js`.
