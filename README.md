# Username Generator

A small tool to generate usernames out of existing words, turned into a website.

## Corpus

I used the sample of the [Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/) from [wordfrequency.info](https://wordfrequency.info),
which you can [**download here**](https://wordfrequency.info/free.asp). It contains the 5,000 most frequent words in the corpus.

If you'd like to use another corpus, make sure you make an array of words for each part of speech in `lib/corpus.js`.
